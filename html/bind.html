BIND(2)                                                               Linux Programmer&#039;s Manual                                                               BIND(2)

NAME
       bind - bind a name to a socket

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;          /* See NOTES */
       #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;

       int bind(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr,
                socklen_t addrlen);

DESCRIPTION
       When  a  socket is created with socket(2), it exists in a name space (address family) but has no address assigned to it.  bind() assigns the address specified
       by addr to the socket referred to by the file descriptor sockfd.  addrlen specifies the size, in bytes, of the address structure pointed to by  addr.   Tradi‐
       tionally, this operation is called “assigning a name to a socket”.

       It is normally necessary to assign a local address using bind() before a SOCK_STREAM socket may receive connections (see accept(2)).

       The  rules used in name binding vary between address families.  Consult the manual entries in Section 7 for detailed information.  For AF_INET, see ip(7); for
       AF_INET6, see ipv6(7); for AF_UNIX, see unix(7); for AF_APPLETALK, see ddp(7); for AF_PACKET, see packet(7); for AF_X25, see x25(7); and for  AF_NETLINK,  see
       netlink(7).

       The actual structure passed for the addr argument will depend on the address family.  The sockaddr structure is defined as something like:

           struct sockaddr {
               sa_family_t sa_family;
               char        sa_data[14];
           }

       The only purpose of this structure is to cast the structure pointer passed in addr in order to avoid compiler warnings.  See EXAMPLES below.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EACCES The address is protected, and the user is not the superuser.

       EADDRINUSE
              The given address is already in use.

       EADDRINUSE
              (Internet  domain sockets) The port number was specified as zero in the socket address structure, but, upon attempting to bind to an ephemeral port, it
              was determined that all port numbers in the ephemeral port range are currently in use.  See the  discussion  of  /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range
              ip(7).

       EBADF  sockfd is not a valid file descriptor.

       EINVAL The socket is already bound to an address.

       EINVAL addrlen is wrong, or addr is not a valid address for this socket&#039;s domain.

       ENOTSOCK
              The file descriptor sockfd does not refer to a socket.

       The following errors are specific to UNIX domain (AF_UNIX) sockets:

       EACCES Search permission is denied on a component of the path prefix.  (See also path_resolution(7).)

       EADDRNOTAVAIL
              A nonexistent interface was requested or the requested address was not local.

       EFAULT addr points outside the user&#039;s accessible address space.

       ELOOP  Too many symbolic links were encountered in resolving addr.

       ENAMETOOLONG
              addr is too long.

       ENOENT A component in the directory prefix of the socket pathname does not exist.

       ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.

       ENOTDIR
              A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

       EROFS  The socket inode would reside on a read-only filesystem.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, SVr4, 4.4BSD (bind() first appeared in 4.2BSD).

NOTES
       POSIX.1  does  not  require the inclusion of &lt;sys/types.h&gt;, and this header file is not required on Linux.  However, some historical (BSD) implementations re‐
       quired this header file, and portable applications are probably wise to include it.

       For background on the socklen_t type, see accept(2).

BUGS
       The transparent proxy options are not described.

EXAMPLES
       An example of the use of bind() with Internet domain sockets can be found in getaddrinfo(3).

       The following example shows how to bind a stream socket in the UNIX (AF_UNIX) domain, and accept connections:

       #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
       #include &lt;sys/un.h&gt;
       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
       #include &lt;string.h&gt;

       #define MY_SOCK_PATH &quot;/somepath&quot;
       #define LISTEN_BACKLOG 50

       #define handle_error(msg) \
           do { perror(msg); exit(EXIT_FAILURE); } while (0)

       int
       main(int argc, char *argv[])
       {
           int sfd, cfd;
           struct sockaddr_un my_addr, peer_addr;
           socklen_t peer_addr_size;

           sfd = socket(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
           if (sfd == -1)
               handle_error(&quot;socket&quot;);

           memset(&amp;my_addr, 0, sizeof(my_addr));
                               /* Clear structure */
           my_addr.sun_family = AF_UNIX;
           strncpy(my_addr.sun_path, MY_SOCK_PATH,
                   sizeof(my_addr.sun_path) - 1);

           if (bind(sfd, (struct sockaddr *) &amp;my_addr,
                   sizeof(my_addr)) == -1)
               handle_error(&quot;bind&quot;);

           if (listen(sfd, LISTEN_BACKLOG) == -1)
               handle_error(&quot;listen&quot;);

           /* Now we can accept incoming connections one
              at a time using accept(2) */

           peer_addr_size = sizeof(peer_addr);
           cfd = accept(sfd, (struct sockaddr *) &amp;peer_addr,
                        &amp;peer_addr_size);
           if (cfd == -1)
               handle_error(&quot;accept&quot;);

           /* Code to deal with incoming connection(s)... */

           /* When no longer required, the socket pathname, MY_SOCK_PATH
              should be deleted using unlink(2) or remove(3) */
       }
