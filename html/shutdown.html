SHUTDOWN(2)                                                           Linux Programmer&#039;s Manual                                                           SHUTDOWN(2)

NAME
       shutdown - shut down part of a full-duplex connection

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;

       int shutdown(int sockfd, int how);

DESCRIPTION
       The  shutdown()  call  causes all or part of a full-duplex connection on the socket associated with sockfd to be shut down.  If how is SHUT_RD, further recep‐
       tions will be disallowed.  If how is SHUT_WR, further transmissions will be disallowed.  If how is SHUT_RDWR, further receptions  and  transmissions  will  be
       disallowed.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EBADF  sockfd is not a valid file descriptor.

       EINVAL An invalid value was specified in how (but see BUGS).

       ENOTCONN
              The specified socket is not connected.

       ENOTSOCK
              The file descriptor sockfd does not refer to a socket.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, 4.4BSD (shutdown() first appeared in 4.2BSD).

NOTES
       The constants SHUT_RD, SHUT_WR, SHUT_RDWR have the value 0, 1, 2, respectively, and are defined in &lt;sys/socket.h&gt; since glibc-2.1.91.

BUGS
       Checks for the validity of how are done in domain-specific code, and before Linux 3.7 not all domains performed these checks.  Most notably, UNIX domain sock‐
       ets simply ignored invalid values.  This problem was fixed for UNIX domain sockets in Linux 3.7.
