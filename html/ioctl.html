IOCTL(2)                                                              Linux Programmer&#039;s Manual                                                              IOCTL(2)

NAME
       ioctl - control device

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt;

       int ioctl(int fd, unsigned long request, ...);

DESCRIPTION
       The  ioctl()  system  call  manipulates the underlying device parameters of special files.  In particular, many operating characteristics of character special
       files (e.g., terminals) may be controlled with ioctl() requests.  The argument fd must be an open file descriptor.

       The second argument is a device-dependent request code.  The third argument is an untyped pointer to memory.  It&#039;s traditionally char *argp (from the days be‐
       fore void * was valid C), and will be so named for this discussion.

       An ioctl() request has encoded in it whether the argument is an in parameter or out parameter, and the size of the argument argp in bytes.  Macros and defines
       used in specifying an ioctl() request are located in the file &lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt;.  See NOTES.

RETURN VALUE
       Usually, on success zero is returned.  A few ioctl() requests use the return value as an output parameter and return a nonnegative value on success.   On  er‐
       ror, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EBADF  fd is not a valid file descriptor.

       EFAULT argp references an inaccessible memory area.

       EINVAL request or argp is not valid.

       ENOTTY fd is not associated with a character special device.

       ENOTTY The specified request does not apply to the kind of object that the file descriptor fd references.

CONFORMING TO
       No  single standard.  Arguments, returns, and semantics of ioctl() vary according to the device driver in question (the call is used as a catch-all for opera‐
       tions that don&#039;t cleanly fit the UNIX stream I/O model).

       The ioctl() system call appeared in Version 7 AT&amp;T UNIX.

NOTES
       In order to use this call, one needs an open file descriptor.  Often the open(2) call has unwanted side effects, that can be avoided under Linux by giving  it
       the O_NONBLOCK flag.

   ioctl structure
       Ioctl command values are 32-bit constants.  In principle these constants are completely arbitrary, but people have tried to build some structure into them.

       The  old  Linux  situation  was  that of mostly 16-bit constants, where the last byte is a serial number, and the preceding byte(s) give a type indicating the
       driver.  Sometimes the major number was used: 0x03 for the HDIO_* ioctls, 0x06 for the LP* ioctls.  And sometimes one or more ASCII letters  were  used.   For
       example, TCGETS has value 0x00005401, with 0x54 = &#039;T&#039; indicating the terminal driver, and CYGETTIMEOUT has value 0x00435906, with 0x43 0x59 = &#039;C&#039; &#039;Y&#039; indicat‐
       ing the cyclades driver.

       Later (0.98p5) some more information was built into the number.  One has 2 direction bits (00: none, 01: write, 10: read, 11: read/write) followed by 14  size
       bits  (giving the size of the argument), followed by an 8-bit type (collecting the ioctls in groups for a common purpose or a common driver), and an 8-bit se‐
       rial number.

       The macros describing this structure live in &lt;asm/ioctl.h&gt; and are _IO(type,nr) and {_IOR,_IOW,_IOWR}(type,nr,size).  They use sizeof(size) so that size is  a
       misnomer here: this third argument is a data type.

       Note  that  the  size  bits  are  very unreliable: in lots of cases they are wrong, either because of buggy macros using sizeof(sizeof(struct)), or because of
       legacy values.

       Thus, it seems that the new structure only gave disadvantages: it does not help in checking, but it causes varying values for the various architectures.
