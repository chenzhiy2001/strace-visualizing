SET_TID_ADDRESS(2)                                                    Linux Programmer&#039;s Manual                                                    SET_TID_ADDRESS(2)

NAME
       set_tid_address - set pointer to thread ID

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lt;linux/unistd.h&gt;

       pid_t set_tid_address(int *tidptr);

       Note: There is no glibc wrapper for this system call; see NOTES.

DESCRIPTION
       For each thread, the kernel maintains two attributes (addresses) called set_child_tid and clear_child_tid.  These two attributes contain the value NULL by de‐
       fault.

       set_child_tid
              If a thread is started using clone(2) with the CLONE_CHILD_SETTID flag, set_child_tid is set to the value passed in the ctid argument  of  that  system
              call.

              When set_child_tid is set, the very first thing the new thread does is to write its thread ID at this address.

       clear_child_tid
              If  a thread is started using clone(2) with the CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID flag, clear_child_tid is set to the value passed in the ctid argument of that sys‐
              tem call.

       The system call set_tid_address() sets the clear_child_tid value for the calling thread to tidptr.

       When a thread whose clear_child_tid is not NULL terminates, then, if the thread is sharing memory with other threads, then 0 is written at the address  speci‐
       fied in clear_child_tid and the kernel performs the following operation:

           futex(clear_child_tid, FUTEX_WAKE, 1, NULL, NULL, 0);

       The  effect of this operation is to wake a single thread that is performing a futex wait on the memory location.  Errors from the futex wake operation are ig‐
       nored.

RETURN VALUE
       set_tid_address() always returns the caller&#039;s thread ID.

ERRORS
       set_tid_address() always succeeds.

VERSIONS
       This call is present since Linux 2.5.48.  Details as given here are valid since Linux 2.5.49.

CONFORMING TO
       This system call is Linux-specific.

NOTES
       Glibc does not provide a wrapper for this system call; call it using syscall(2).
